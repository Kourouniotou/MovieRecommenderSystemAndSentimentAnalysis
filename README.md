# MovieRecommenderSystemAndSentimentAnalysis


In the current project, we used two datasets. The first contained information about the movies from Rotten Tomatoes
website, and the second contained movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes users.
Initially, we created a non-personalized recommender system for movies by using the first dataset, and after that, 
we implemented sentiment analysis on movie reviews in order to be able to classify the new reviews of our users.
Finally, these implementations were organized into an easy-to-use application for the user by using the tkinter library.
